# Developer Roadmap
The list below is the topics that I would like to have some knowledge about when finishing my software engineering degree. Some topics are more important for me than others. Networks and operating systems are technologies that I most likely won't be working on directly, but they are topics that I believe are nice to have some basic knowledge about.

## Topics
1. Network
2. Operating systems
3. Front-end
4. Back-end
5. Algorithms and data structures
6. Web security
7. DevOps
